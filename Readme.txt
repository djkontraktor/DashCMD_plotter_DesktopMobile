Welcome to William Christian's DashCmd Reader for both iPhone and Desktop.

Android smartphones have not been tested, but may work with the mobile program.

This program reads logfiles exported from the app "DashCmd," which is an OBDII interface app designed to log data captured from an OBDII reading device.

It then plots graphs of each collected data vs. time, and additionally features a "dyno graph" mode, where HP and torque samples are aggregated and viewed vs. engine RPM.

It only reads files exported in the .csv format from that app.

Viewable parameters are basic for now, and will grow as this program develops.
